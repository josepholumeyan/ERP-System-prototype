    2.Refine the user interface for a smoother experience
    3.Scale application up with frameworks both back and frontend

PURPOSE
    The main purpose of this project was to test and as well strengthen my practical programming skills by working on something beyond simple scripts.It reflects my progress in python development and my growing interest in building real-worlsd applications.
